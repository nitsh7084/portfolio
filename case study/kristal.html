Because the majority of the visual styling decisions were already in place from the design system, I turned my attention to the interaction design — which involved prototyping… from scrolling interactions and shadows, to focus states and animation.These prototypes were also used in extensive user testing, which were performed every 2 weeks to ensure we didn’t get too lost in exploration or polish — and were remaining true to our hypothesis and design principles.The below example, showing how a board can be filtered by assignee, is a good demonstration of how visual decisions needed to be made in code rather than from static design files.
